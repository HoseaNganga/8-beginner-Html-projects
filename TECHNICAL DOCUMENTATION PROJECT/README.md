## Description

HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages. This project serves as a technical documentation page, explaining various aspects of HTML and CSS implementation. The documentation covers fundamental topics, including HTML editors, elements, attributes, headings, paragraphs, styles, formatting, and includes a reference section.

## HTML Editors

While you can use a simple text editor like Notepad to create and edit HTML documents, it is recommended to use open-source HTML editors available on the internet. These editors provide a better interactive user interface and additional functionalities.

## HTML Elements

HTML elements provide semantic meaning to the content of a web page. Although the terms "HTML elements" and "tags" are often used interchangeably, they technically refer to different entities. An HTML tag is the character inside angle brackets, while an HTML element is a collection of starting tag, attributes, content, and end tag.

## HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about elements on a web page. While most HTML elements don't require attributes, some elements necessitate their use. Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an HTML element, following a name and value pair format.

## HTML Headings

HTML headings, represented by the `h1` to `h6` tags, are used to display section headings, titles, or subtitles. The `h1` tag denotes the largest heading, while `h6` represents the smallest or subheading. Content specified within heading tags is displayed prominently on the web page.

## HTML Paragraphs

HTML paragraphs are defined using the `p` element. Paragraph text always starts from a new line, and the browser automatically adds margin and white space after the end of a `p` tag.

## HTML Styles

Every browser has a specific engine that parses the HTML document and displays a default style for the page content.

## HTML Formatting

In HTML, there are special elements that provide unique meaning to text content, allowing for various formatting options.

## Reference

All the documentation in this page is taken from [Html Format](https://www.techgeekbuzz.com/tutorial/html).
